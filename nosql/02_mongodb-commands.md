# MongoDB Commands

Several of the basic MongoDB commands which I have used in the past are now escaping me 
so it is time to write them down as snippets so I can easily reference them.

## Common Commands with MySQL Equivalents


| MongoDB | MySQL |
|---------|-------|
| `show dbs`                | `show databases;` |
| `use <db>`                | `use <db>;` |
| `show collections`        | `show tables;` |
| `db.<collection>.find()`  | `SELECT * FROM <table>;` |
| `db.dropDatabase()`       | `DROP DATABASE;` |
